							<h1>My first ever Game, ChupaCOWbra!</h1>
                            <p>I do believe that, games are the apex of the art expression. Blending visual art, sound design, 3D, and the interactions we can have with all these elements is an experience like no other medium can deliver. Wether its a fun little game to entertain or a massive architectural experience, the game experience can deliver the most amazing of human experience with the digital world.</p>
                            <h2>Play ChupaCOWbra here!</h2>

                            <p>Games. When I first glanced the possibility to work doing games, still a teenager, my mind would spiral out of control with excitement. Born in the 80s, I lived the video game boom experiencing every step of it, up to the point that I had to afford them myself. I played the Ataris, the 8bit era of NES and Master System, the 16bit jewels that were Super Nintendo and the Mega Drive (Sega Genesis) and I saw the 3D trend becoming the norm with Playstation and Sega Saturn. I just did not know how to get there. I thought 3D would be the way, and that was my first 3D experience, 13 year old me, trying to figure things out.</p>
							<p>I ended up becaming an Industrial Designer, but always working with 3D, parametric or not. Architecture became my hobbie and later my main occupation with architectural visualization. I fell back to the idea of games when I was trying to find that extra to deliver to my clients. And the next step was obvious, interactive archviz.</p>
							<p>I made the 3D models, texturing and animations using Blender (most amazing 3D software ever), Unity Game Engine to make the game.</P>
