							<h1>The teaser that got me a Gamedev job... Sort of...&#127918;</h1>

                            <p>Since my gamedev journey begun, all the work I have done to that point, have been freelance or personal projects. I have never got in touch or worked for a gamedev company. This was my very first contact with a big mobile games company and this was the resulting teaser that got me the position... For a day...  </p>

                                </video>The experience begun with a LinkedIn message from a producer asking if I wanted to participate on the selection process so... OMG right? </br>The position was for the marketing department, but the work would require knowledge in Unity cinemachine, Unity timeline, Particle effects, 3D art and retopology, photography and cinematography. Fun right? I was excited as hell, and after three interviews, I've got to the final phase of the selection process.</br>The test was a small teaser with predefined assets, with a mandatory "bullet-time" effect. A set of models, particles and pipelines. The resulting teaser would be evaluated by the team and they would choose "their guy". How surprised I was, when after a week, I got a call from the recruiter, saying that the position would be mine. I was explained where I would work, how much I would earn and who should I answer to... Happy dances all over the house, wife and kids, mom and dad, friends and acquaintances, all very happy and excited for me. I finally got my first gamedev job! GOD DAMN! I'VE GOT IT!</p>
                                <p>Well, you know when people say that something seems too good to be true? How surprised I was, when after a couple of days, the recruiter called me with bad news. During the recruiting, the company was also, laying off people and part of the marketing team would be laid off as well. So the recruiting part, stopped. I wasn't going to be part of the team anymore, due to the reestructuring of the company. I was devastated, but at the same time vary excited... That was the first time I saw that I got what it takes to make it to the industry. Working for someone or by myself, it was clear for me that I could do great things.</p>
