                            <p>As a designer, we are tought to analize a problem from many perspectives in order to find an appropriate solution. The side effect of that, if you are curious like me, is that you are going to get in touch with many different approaches to a solution, not always in your field of expertise. To me it was simple... I was going to learn everything!</p>
							<p>The competitive market also makes you turn your boat to the best opportunity, as it presents itself, and you may be required to learn the needs of the position, which also helped me build the variety of skills I have today. When the time came for me to change again, I took to myself and decided I would became a freelancer. I would learn what I wanted to learn regardless of market or wages. Luckily for me, I wanted to be a game developer and artist. I grew up during the 80's and 90's, with the video game boom, and to became part of it (the game industry), would be like a dream.</p>

                                <code>i = 0;
while (mind.isCurious()) 
    {
        learn(new_stuff[i]);
        print 'Mind is blown by this '+ new_stuff[i] +' I've learned!';
        drink(coffe);
        i++;
    }</code>
                            </pre>
                            <p>I begun my 3D journey before my graduation. A teen keen to learn something remotely related to games. My creative side took over and I jumped in the 3D world with my first try with GMax, a free version of 3D Studio MAX, at the time, from Discreet, not Autodesk. My first project, obviously, a sports car (omg... xD). A short lived Engineering course (I dropped after 2 years of pain) took me to parametric 3D software, and right after that I graduated in Industrial Design, where I could use non-parametric and parametric 3D software to achieve my designs.</p>
                            <P>Between many employed and unemployed, I did freelance with achitecture, scenery, furniture, displays and some others. But I wanted to make them move on command... Jump, kick, roll and shoot. I wanted to be able to walk my archviz, to turn its lights on, to opens its doors. So the next step was simple and quite obvious (I still don't know why I took so long to try it). Learn a game engine and everything game developing related. So I jumped in, head first, thinking I was awesome... Disclaimer: I wasn't.</P>
                            <p>Games are the apex of communication media, it is the amagamation of all art into one medium. You can see a beautiful artwork while listening to a cool soundtrack, interacting with other people in unimaginable worlds and means and VR and AR, wether people like it or not, are going to be the main medium for the consumption of that media. Game development is going to be the norm in everyday life. To work, to leisure, to medical and academia. It is an unescapable and wonderful evolution of the gaming industry, and I am going to be there, to be a part of it.</br>
